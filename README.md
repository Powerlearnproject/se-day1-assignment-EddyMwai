# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
SE is the process of designing and developing an efficient and reliable software.
It's important because it provides an approach on planning, designing, implementing and maintaining software projects. It also ensures needs such as scalability and reliability are met. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Understanding user requirements- this involves collection and documentation of user needs.
b) Requirement analysis- Involves analysing factors such as time and financial constraints and coming upwith a schedule.
c) Design creation- Involves coming up with blueprints for the software through making low level and high level models of the architecture.
d) Implementation- This is the coding, testing and deployment of the software according to the user needs.
Maintenance- It is the modification and addition of new features depending on user needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A softwar developer mainly does the designing and implementation of the software development process. They code and test the software while debugging the software made.
A quality assurance engineer does the testing of the system to ensure that it meets the ser needs and is effective in carrying out tasks.
A project manager is involved in the planning and scheduling the process of software development. They act as the link between the stakeholders and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Increasing user demands- there are varied needs for the customer hence the engineers have to understand the business concept and bring the required features to satisfy the growing needs.
b) Time limitations- working under pressured environments eithstrict deadlines that need to be achieved to meet user needs hence the software engneershave to negotiate realistic time frames and have dedication towads completion of the projet.
c) Limited resources- inadequate resources to carry out a the development is challenging hence there is need to make sure good machine and resources are gotten to ensure the work is done well.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
