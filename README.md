# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
SE is the process of designing and developing an efficient and reliable software.
It's important because it provides an approach on planning, designing, implementing and maintaining software projects. It also ensures needs such as scalability and reliability are met. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) Development of structured programming brought order and discipline to coding practices.
b) The Waterfall Model introduced a systematic approach to software development.
c) Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Understanding user requirements- this involves collection and documentation of user needs.
b) Requirement analysis- Involves analysing factors such as time and financial constraints and coming upwith a schedule.
c) Design creation- Involves coming up with blueprints for the software through making low level and high level models of the architecture.
d) Implementation- This is the coding, testing and deployment of the software according to the user needs.
Maintenance- It is the modification and addition of new features depending on user needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method used for projects with clear requirements follows a linear, sequential flow with defined stages while agile method used for projects with dynamic requirements follows an iterative cyclical flow with continuous feedback and improvements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A softwar developer mainly does the designing and implementation of the software development process. They code and test the software while debugging the software made.
A quality assurance engineer does the testing of the system to ensure that it meets the ser needs and is effective in carrying out tasks.
A project manager is involved in the planning and scheduling the process of software development. They act as the link between the stakeholders and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs such as Visual Studio code and IntelliJ assist in code editting and navigation for debugging and testing while VCS such as git and mercurial help in code collaboration and verson control of the code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) Increasing user demands- there are varied needs for the customer hence the engineers have to understand the business concept and bring the required features to satisfy the growing needs.
b) Time limitations- working under pressured environments eithstrict deadlines that need to be achieved to meet user needs hence the software engneershave to negotiate realistic time frames and have dedication towads completion of the projet.
c) Limited resources- inadequate resources to carry out a the development is challenging hence there is need to make sure good machine and resources are gotten to ensure the work is done well.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual modules and functions during development to ensure effectivity. It helps in improving code and early debugging.
Integration testing tests for working of diffeent modules together to ensure the relationships are effective between moduels to ensure compatibility and detect interface issues.
System testing involves testing the whole sofware as a whole to validate system behaviour and efficiency.
Acceptance testing involves testing the system against the requirements to validate user needs for the system.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating questions and statements to get optimal and best responses from AI. It helps to craft the necessary questions so that AI can understand what you need and give the best answer.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: "Summarise the text"
Improved: "Summarize the above text to 300 words and highlight main points"
The improved prompt helps the AI understand the question well and hence give otimal answers.
